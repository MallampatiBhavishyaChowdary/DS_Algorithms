# DS_Algorithms
A collection of data structures and algorithms (in Python/Go) that I will keep on updating as and when I learn.

| The Individual/User that is protected | Protects EU residents and data subjects whose data are collected by covered companies                                                                                                                                                      | Protects California residents (whether they’re currently in the state or not)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Personal Data vs Personal Information | ‘Personal data’ is any data that is related to an identified or identifiable data subject                                                                                                                                                  | ‘Personal information’ is any information that identifies, relates to, describes, and is linked to or associated with a consumer or household                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|    Business/Company to be regulated   | It might cover all companies that process EU data whether they’re established in the EU or not, and regardless of where the actual data processing takes place.                                                                            | Applies to businesses, headquartered inside or outside of California, that collect personal information of California State Residents and that satisfy at least one of three conditions: 1. Annual Gross revenue more than $25 million. 2. Handling (buying, selling, etc.) personal information of more than 50,000 CA consumers, households, or devices annually. 3. Gets at least 50% of annual revenue from selling CA consumers’ personal information. |
|             The Main Focus            | The GDPR focusses significantly more on accountability-related obligations and frequently requires having a “legal basis” concerning the need for data processing. It doesn’t explicitly address the sale of information to third parties. | The CCPA focusses primarily on transparency-related obligations and provisions that inform them about your company’s data sales practices and limit the sale of personal information. The CCPA requires no legal basis as such as a justification for collecting and using personal info.                                                                                                                                                                   |
|              Application              | The GDPR is applicable to publicly available data.                                                                                                                                                                                         | The CCPA is not applicable to publicly available data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|        Disclosure Requirements        | Puts disclosure requirements and restricts collection and processing of personal data.                                                                                                                                                     | Puts disclosure requirements for collection, selling and sharing of personal information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|   Data Collection Opt Out Technique   | GDPR requires that people must consent to a company collecting their data.                                                                                                                                                                 | CCPA doesn't require an opt-in, but it mandates that people have an ability to opt-out from collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|          Time Span to Respond         | Obliges data controllers to comply with a verifiable data subject request within a month.                                                                                                                                                  | Obliges businesses to comply with a verifiable consumer request within 45 days                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   Legal Binding for Data Collection   | Requires companies to have a lawful basis to handle personal data.                                                                                                                                                                         | Doesn’t impose a lawful basis as a requirement for the purposes of handling personal information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|           Fine for Violation          | Fine for violation is up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual revenue/turnover, whichever is greater.                                                                                                                                       | Fine for violation is $2,500 to $7,500.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
